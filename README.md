# Overview
This contains some basic PCB designs, made with KiCad 5.1.6 for learning the process of PCB design.
These will generally be in the form of breakout boards, so they can be fitted into a breadboard for prototyping

## TODO
* Fix issues with the touch breakout not having soldermask covering the cap pads
* Create breakout for different SMD LEDs with low power, and wide viewing angle
* Create breakout for capacitive triggers
* Pogo pins to header breakout
* Consider ESP32 for the Bluetooth solution - maybe uses too much power?
  * Might be able to some filtering onboard with the Xtensas
